  "Coding isn't the only thing I like to do - I love playing with my dog, smashing buttons on video games, and binge-watching on Netflix.",
  "Sometimes, when the mood is just right, I like take a drive into the mountains for scenic cruise or enjoy a nice hike.",
  "But most of all, if I could leisure endlessly, I would find myself in another country immersed in all their food and culture."
